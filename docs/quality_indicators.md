Here are the key indicators for measuring scientific paper quality, focused on relevance, low redundancy, and high signal-to-noise:

## Core Quality Metrics (5-10 Key Indicators)

### 1. **Conceptual Novelty Rate (CNR)**
- **What**: Percentage of genuinely new concepts/ideas per section
- **Target**: 40-60% new material per major section
- **Calculation**: 
  - Extract unique technical concepts, theorems, equations, claims
  - Measure: `(Unique concepts in section N not in prior sections) / (Total concepts in section N)`
- **Red flag**: CNR < 20% indicates excessive redundancy

### 2. **Claim Density (CD)**
- **What**: Ratio of falsifiable claims to total word count
- **Target**: 1 substantive claim per 100-200 words
- **Calculation**: Count statements that make testable/verifiable assertions
- **Red flag**: Long passages without any specific claims = "fluff"

### 3. **Mathematical Rigor Index (MRI)**
- **What**: Ratio of proved statements to stated theorems/lemmas
- **Target**: 100% for theorems, 80%+ for lemmas, explicit citations for known results
- **Calculation**: Track:
  - Theorems with proofs
  - Lemmas with proofs  
  - Claims cited to literature
  - Unsubstantiated assertions (should be ~0%)
- **Red flag**: Repeated intuitive arguments without formal proofs

### 4. **Semantic Compression Ratio (SCR)**
- **What**: How much the paper could be compressed without losing content
- **Target**: < 2:1 compression ratio (paper shouldn't be reducible to half size)
- **Calculation**:
  - Generate abstractive summary preserving all unique claims
  - Ratio: `(Original length) / (Minimal length preserving all unique content)`
- **Red flag**: SCR > 3:1 means major redundancy problem

### 5. **Citation Density & Novelty Context (CDNC)**
- **What**: How well the work is situated in existing literature
- **Target**: 
  - 15-40 citations per 10 pages (field-dependent)
  - Clear statement of what's new vs. known
- **Calculation**:
  - Citations per page
  - Ratio of "as established in [X]" vs. uncited claims
  - Presence of explicit novelty statements
- **Red flag**: Major claims about established fields with zero citations

### 6. **Empirical Grounding Score (EGS)**
- **What**: Connection to observable/testable predictions
- **Target**: At least 2-3 testable predictions or experimental connections
- **Calculation**: Count:
  - Novel experimental predictions
  - Connections to existing experimental results
  - Falsifiable claims
  - Purely philosophical/circular arguments (should be minimal)
- **Red flag**: Pure tautology (A is true because B, B is true because A)

### 7. **Structural Coherence Index (SCI)**
- **What**: Logical flow and absence of circular reasoning
- **Target**: Linear dependency graph, < 10% backward references
- **Calculation**:
  - Build dependency graph of claims
  - Measure: cycles in reasoning, forward vs. backward references
  - Check: Does section N depend on concepts only introduced in section N+M?
- **Red flag**: Circular dependencies, conclusions that assume premises

### 8. **Notation Consistency Rate (NCR)**
- **What**: Consistent use of mathematical symbols and terminology
- **Target**: 100% - same symbol = same meaning throughout
- **Calculation**: 
  - Track all symbol definitions
  - Flag redefinitions or ambiguous uses
- **Red flag**: ρ means density on page 3, correlation on page 10

### 9. **Figure/Equation Information Density (FEID)**
- **What**: Do visuals and equations add information or repeat text?
- **Target**: Each figure/equation should convey info not in surrounding text
- **Calculation**: 
  - Can figure be removed without information loss? (should be "no")
  - Does equation restate what's in text? (should be "no")
- **Red flag**: Decorative figures, equations that merely repeat prose

### 10. **Parsimony Score (PS)**
- **What**: Ockham's razor - simplest sufficient explanation
- **Target**: No auxiliary hypotheses beyond those needed for the claims
- **Calculation**:
  - List all assumptions/postulates
  - Check which are actually used in proofs
  - Ratio: `(Essential assumptions) / (Total assumptions)`
- **Red flag**: PS < 0.7 means introducing unnecessary complexity

## Application to Your Document

Your document would score:

| Metric | Your Score       | Target     | Assessment       |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| CNR    | ~8%              | 40-60%     | Critical failure |
| CD     | ~0.3 claims/100w | 0.5-1.0    | Poor             |
| MRI    | ~30%             | 80-100%    | Needs work       |
| SCR    | ~15:1            | <2:1       | Critical failure |
| CDNC   | 0 citations      | 15-40/10pg | Critical failure |
| EGS    | ~2 predictions   | 2-3        | Borderline       |
| SCI    | High circularity | Low cycles | Poor             |
| NCR    | ~95%             | 100%       | Good             |
| FEID   | No figures       | N/A        | Incomplete       |
| PS     | ~60%             | >70%       | Borderline       |

## Actionable Recommendations

To fix your document:

1. **Extract unique claims** - list every truly novel assertion (probably 20-30 claims total)
2. **One proof per claim** - prove it once, completely, never repeat
3. **Add citations** - properly situate in quantum information literature  
4. **Compress ruthlessly** - target 10-15 pages maximum
5. **Add figures** - dependency graphs, example systems, experimental setups
6. **Eliminate circularity** - ensure linear logical flow

The goal: reader should finish knowing exactly what's new and why it matters, with no need to re-read due to redundancy.
